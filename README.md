The files contained in this repository are the programs created for the development of the Bachelor Thesis equally named. In it the Redfiled equation is solved via the direct resolution of the ODE equation, as well as by the employment of the Monte Carlo Wave Function Method (MCWF). 

A particular system is analyzed in ecah case, although other systems can be studied by changing the values of the code. In the same way, a generalization for N dimensions for each method has been developed.
